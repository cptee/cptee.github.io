# About Me
Hi! My name is Lucas and I go as Cptee on my hacking endeavors. I am a software engineer with two years of experience working as a backend engineer, now aiming to become a penetration tester. 

I began my offsec studies in early 2021, having attained the eJPT (eLearnSecurity's Junior Penetration Tester) by the end of the year, and now preparing for the OSCP!

I created this page to share my findings and some walkthroughs (mainly in HackTheBox). I hope you can learn anything from this content.

You can find me at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-shiozawa/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://github.com/cptee">GitHub</a> and I would be happy to chat with you.

Thank you for reading.
